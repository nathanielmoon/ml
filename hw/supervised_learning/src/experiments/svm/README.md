## Experiment 1

Evaluates SVM performance in relation to kernel with penguin datasets.

## Experiment 2

Evaluates SVM performance in relation to kernel with hypersphere dataset.

## Experiment 3

Evaluates SVM performance in relation to training data size with hypersphere dataset

This uses optimal parameters found in the previous two experiments:

## Experiment 4

Evaluates SVM performance in relation to class count

## Experiment 5

Evaluates SVM performance in relation to dimensionality

## Experiment 6

This experiment explores the curse of dimensionality

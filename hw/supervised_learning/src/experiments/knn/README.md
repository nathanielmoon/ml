## Experiment 1

This experiment will examine optimal pruning using min_samples_leaf against the penugin dataset

## Experiment 2

This experiment will examine optimal pruning using min_samples_leaf against the hypersphere dataset

## Experiment 3

Evaluates decision tree performance in relation to training data size with penguin dataset

This uses optimal parameters found in the previous two experiments:

## Experiment 4

Evaluates SVM performance in relation to class count

## Experiment 5

Evaluates SVM performance in relation to dimensionality

## Experiment 6

This experiment explores the curse of dimensionality
